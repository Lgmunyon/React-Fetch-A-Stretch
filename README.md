# Fetch A Stretch - React (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

As I've transitioned from the wellness industry to a more sedentary career I've noticed something; I don't move as well as I use to, I have new aches and pains, and my posture has become worse. I've used my knowledge from my previous line of work as a Corrective Exercise Specialist to correct some of the muscular imbalances I've begun to notice, and I realized that it can't just be me. There are thousands of people who sit at a desk all day working who get sore, ache, and stiff. I want to help with that. 

Fetch A Stretch is a React project so it is simple, easy, and FREE to find the exercises and stretches that you need to be doing to specifically counteract a day of sitting at a desk, a car, and at home. I have created my own API with the stretch name, description, and a video showing how it is done. My goal is simple, to help people move and feel better in their day to day life. Everything here can be done without equipment, and almost all can be done at your desk with no need to find a specific place to do them (although I encourage you to get up and move around a bit regardless).

# Primary Languages

Javascript, React.js, Node.js. Styling done using CSS. 

# Current Phase
